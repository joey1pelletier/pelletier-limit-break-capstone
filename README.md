# Limit Break

## Abstract

Created with React.js and Next.js, Limit Break is a web app that allows me (the main user) to conquer my big fears and anxieties via journaling, answering guiding questions/prompts that are based on what I've been asked during past therapy sessions, and conquering smaller fears/actions that build up to said big fear. The app will also keep track of all the fears I conquer and include additional resources that are either from the web or from what I learned in past therapy sessions. In the case of an emergency (panic attacks, unescapable thoughts of hopelessness, etc.), pressing an emergency button will guide me to mental resources, along with providing a document that includes any user input added to fears, actions, and question/prompt answers. That way, when handed to a medical professional, they can have a better idea on how to assist through the current situation.

## Winter Break Progress

### My Goals for Winter Break

Considering I did not work on this project over break, I did not have any goals to accomplish, other than just recovering from the previous semester.

### My Accomplishments and Reflection on Time Management

Again, I did not work on the project over break. Because of that, my time management will need to change from recovery mode to floor-it-get-things-done mode.

### Integration of Feedback

Other than applying RMPP panel feedback (required to pass RMPP) to my project concept, no other work has been done over break.

### Learned Lessons

Because I have not worked on the project over break, I learned that working over break would've made the capstone sequence less stressful and time-consuming. Therefore, I will need to prioritize more time towards working on my project this semester.
