# Limit Break

## Abstract

Created with React.js and Next.js, Limit Break is a web app that allows me (the main user) to conquer my big fears and anxieties via journaling, answering guiding questions/prompts that are based on what I've been asked during past therapy sessions, and conquering smaller fears/actions that build up to said big fear. The app will also keep track of all the fears I conquer and include additional resources that are either from the web or from what I learned in past therapy sessions. In the case of an emergency (panic attacks, unescapable thoughts of hopelessness, etc.), pressing an emergency button will guide me to mental resources, along with providing a document that includes any user input added to fears, actions, and question/prompt answers. That way, when handed to a medical professional, they can have a better idea on how to assist through the current situation.

## Winter Break Progress

### My Goals for Winter Break

Considering I did not work on this project over break, I did not have any goals to accomplish, other than just recovering from the previous semester.

### My Accomplishments and Reflection on Time Management

Again, I did not work on the project over break. Because of that, my time management will need to change from recovery mode to floor-it-get-things-done mode.

### Integration of Feedback

Other than applying RMPP panel feedback (required to pass RMPP) to my project concept, no other work has been done over break.

### Learned Lessons

Because I have not worked on the project over break, I learned that working over break would've made the capstone sequence less stressful and time-consuming. Therefore, I will need to prioritize more time towards working on my project this semester.

## Project Milestones

### 30% Project Complete Mark

This progress mark will be the deadline (January 28th) for the following items:

- Entire Figma UI mock-up of Limit Break will be completed, and ready to be user-tested and critiqued
- Sufficient knowledge and practice of React.js and Next.js will be gained, that way project development can start smoothly.
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4rFhThSX04 will be the main learning resource.

### 50% Project Complete Mark

This progress mark will be the deadline for the following items:
- Feedback from user-testing and critique will be applied to the UI of Limit Break.
- Fear-conquering part of Limit Break (the part circled on the diagram photo below) will be fully developed with React.js (front-end UI) and Next.js (database of user info and input).

### 90% Project Complete Mark

This progress mark will be the deadline for the following items:
- All app components will be fully developed, and ready for final user-testing and critique.
- Final user-testing and critique will make room for bug fixes and final touches.

### 100% Project Complete Mark

This progress mark will be the deadline for the following items:
- Final bug fixes and touches are applied to the project, and will be ready for Expo.

## Week 1 Goals

These are the goals that should be completed by next week:
- Using feedback from the ATLS 4630 prototype of Limit Break, create a Figma mockup that shows the UI and functionality of the circled part of the diagram from the picture above. 
    -   Be sure to let users test out the process of doing the process above. Do they understand what the app is telling them to do? What are the difficulties that users will run into? Use feedback for re-iterations.
    -   At the very minimum, this can be done as a paper prototype.
- Keep following the React tutorial, and if possible, add the learned techniques to the overall project. Think of how this can be added to the project functionality.
- Start learning how to add databases with Next.js.
